Getting Started with Grunt. 
==========================

1. Install Node, by clicking install [on the Node website](http://nodejs.org/ ) 

2. Update package.json with your new projuct name, 
(lowercase_underscore).
    

5. (install Grunt via node package manager) In Terminal run `npm install -g grunt-cli`
6. (optional: customize files) Go into the Gruntfile.js and update file path accordingly to your images directory / scss & css / files to watch etc...

7. (start up grunt & watch) In Terminal run: `grunt`
8. (start up grunt server, so you can use things like typekit) In Terminal run: `grunt connect`. In your browser go to http://localhost:4000

All installed packages can be seen in the package.json file, and installation customizations are taken care of in the Gruntfile.js. Search for other packages and installations
[through the Node Package Manager](https://npmjs.org/).
